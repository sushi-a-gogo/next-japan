Next Japan is a full-stack demo app that exists in an imaginary world inspired by Japanese Anime, allowing
imaginary users to register for special events hosted at various locales in Japan.
Built as a portfolio project, it demonstrates modern front-end architecture, full REST API design, OpenAI
integration, and cloud deployment â€” all wrapped in a playful, visually engaging concept.

Goals
- Demonstrate Angular v20 component-driven development
- Learn modern reactive angular programming techniques with signals, computed(), and effect()
- Implement a real-world REST API with Node.js/Express
- Deploy both frontend and backend to the cloud (Render)
- Integrate OpenAI and xAI APIs to enhance interactivity
- Cloudflare Images integration for optimized, globally cached image delivery
- SSR for optimized performance and SEO

Tech Stack

Layer Tools Used
- Frontend Angular v20, Angular Material
- Backend Node.js, Express, serverless-style API design
- MongoDB for persistent event storage and dynamic content management
- Hosting Render (static + web service)
- Cloudflare Image Hosting
- Integration OpenAI and xAI APIs (text and image generation, assistant logic)
- Environment .env variables, prod/dev configs, CORS, rate limiting for AI endpoints

### AI-Generated Events
Events can be generated using OpenAI/xAI integration. The backend ensures all events, including AI-generated ones, can be saved to MongoDB.
