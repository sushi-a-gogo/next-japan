Next Japan is a full-stack demo app that exists in an imaginary world inspired by Japanese Anime, allowing
imaginary users to register for special events hosted at various locales in Japan.
Built as a portfolio project, it demonstrates modern front-end architecture, full REST API design, OpenAI
integration, and cloud deployment â€” all wrapped in a playful, visually engaging concept.

- Demonstrate Angular v20 component-driven development
- Implement a real-world REST API with Express
- Deploy both frontend and backend to the cloud (Render)
- Integrate OpenAI API to enhance interactivity
- Optimize for cold-start latency and client-side routing
