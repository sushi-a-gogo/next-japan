export const haikuPrompt = `Generate a haiku in English that uniquely describes 'Next Japan'
- a Japanese vacation event planning website.
  Each line must start with a completely different, randomly chosen Unicode emoji embodying any aspect of
  Japanese culture, travel, or mystery (no examples provided).
  Explore a bold, unpredictable theme (e.g., cyberpunk Osaka, ancient tea rituals, haunted Aomori forests, futuristic Hokkaido farms),
  explicitly avoiding any repeated imagery, themes, or emojis from past outputs.
  Randomly switch between poetic styles (e.g., haiku with haibun flair, free-verse twist, or mythic tone) and perspectives
  (e.g., a lost tourist, a wandering fox spirit, a futuristic AI guide).
  Ensure the haiku is vibrant, evocative, and captures the diverse magic of Japanese travel.
  If you want, provide a brief explanation (explanation only, 25 words or less, and do NOT label it as an 'explanation')
  of the haiku's meaning - but this is optional.`;
